# Explorer-TDSP

This repository showcases my individual efforts in a data science project aimed at enhancing road safety, with a focus on vulnerable road users like pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Through extensive data analysis and exploration, I aim to derive actionable insights and propose practical recommendations to improve road safety globally.

## Milestones
This project comprises six milestones, of which I have successfully completed four:

1. **Milestone 1: Data Preparation**
    - Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.
    - Formatting the data for analysis to ensure compatibility with analysis tools.

2. **Milestone 2: Data Ethics, Pre-Processing, and Exploration**
    - Examining the dataset for potential biases and ethical considerations.
    - Preprocessing the data to handle missing values and outliers.
    - Exploring the dataset to gain insights into road safety trends and patterns.

3. **Milestone 3: Time Series Analysis**
    - Analyzing temporal patterns in motor vehicle collision data.
    - Using time series analysis techniques to forecast future collision trends.

4. **Milestone 4: Geospatial Analysis**
    - Conducting geospatial analysis to understand the spatial distribution of collisions.
    - Visualizing collision hotspots on maps to identify high-risk areas.

Work is in progress for the remaining two milestones:

5. Milestone 5: Self-Guided Research Question *(Work in Progress)*
6. Milestone 6: Virtual Poster Board Creation: Data Storytelling *(Work in Progress)*

## Project Overview
Leveraging the New York City OpenData transportation dataset, I apply data science tools and techniques to derive data-driven insights on enhancing road safety. By analyzing motor vehicle collision data, I gain insights into potential biases within the data, crucial for ensuring ethical data science practices. Additionally, I create informative data visualizations and develop analytical models aimed at real-world deployment.
