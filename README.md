# Explorer-TDSP
This repository showcases my individual efforts in a data science project focused on enhancing road safety, particularly for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Through data analysis and exploration, I've aimed to derive insights and propose practical recommendations to improve road safety globally.

There are 6 Milestones in this project. Out of the 6, I have completed 4 successfully and I am working on the rest 2. Here is the list:
Milestone 1: Data Preparation
Milestone 2: Data Ethics, Pre-Processing, and Exploration
Milestone 3: Time Series Analysis
Milestone 4: Geospatial Analysis
Milestone 5: Self-Guided Research Question
Milestone 6: Virtual Poster Board Creation: Data Storytelling
